# weather-website
made a simple weather website using HTML ,  JAVASCRIPT, CSS. NODEJS, SERVER.JS ,SCRIPT and JQUERY
Here's a detailed overview of the weather forecasting site project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js:


The project involves creating a web application that allows users to search for weather forecasts by city name. The application will use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather data and display it on the webpage. The project will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend.


The frontend will consist of an HTML file that will contain a form with an input field for the city name and a button to submit the request. The CSS file will be used to style the webpage and make it visually appealing. The JavaScript file will contain the logic for handling the form submission, fetching the weather data from the API, and displaying it on the webpage.


The backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js. The server will listen for incoming requests on a specific port and will handle the requests accordingly. When a request is received, the server will use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for the specified city and will send the data back to the client as a response.


The project will also involve error handling and debugging to ensure that the application works smoothly and efficiently. The application will be tested on different devices and browsers to ensure that it is compatible with all platforms.


Some of the key features of the project include:


- User-friendly interface for searching weather forecasts by city name
- Real-time weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API
- Display of current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- Error handling and debugging for smooth application performance
- Compatibility with different devices and browsers


Overall, the project aims to create a simple and efficient weather forecasting web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.
